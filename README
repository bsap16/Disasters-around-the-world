World's disasters 

✈️ This project began with the intention of analyzing aviation disaster data worldwide.  
🌎 My curiosity about the data available in The International Disasters Database was sparked by the possibility of gaining insights into other events that have affected and continue to affect the world.  
🔎 This project starts with the aim of observing the data and trying to understand patterns for potential predictions and prevention based on the data.  
📊 This is a challenging project for a beginner data analyst, who will finally be able to use curiosity to try to contribute to the world. It is the first of many projects to come.
